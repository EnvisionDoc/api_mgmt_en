# API Management

EnOS API Management (APIM) helps organizations publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to unlock the potential of their data and services. You can use API management to configure specific policies, controling and managing API-specific parameters. It covers the lifecycle of an API, from design to testing, managment, and publishing. It also manages the security, flow control, logging, billing, monitoring and reporting of an API.

The API Management decouples the production and consumption of APIs. Changes to the backend APIs do not affect the frontend application's continued access to the APIs. There is no need to change the code or configurations of the front-end applications.
